## Backdrop

* Be aware of your background
* What are you wearing (logos)

## Lighting

* Light sources should be out of the shot
* Try to avoid windows behind the subject
* Use diffuse light -- large light sources -- when possible to avoid hard shadows

## Sound

* Test the mic on your phone/computer vs. earbuds and use what sounds best
* USB mics are an inexpensive upgrade ($20-$40) if you want better sound
