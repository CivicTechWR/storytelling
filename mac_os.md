## Recording on a Mac OS-powered computer

* Open QuickTime Player
* In the top left corner, select File > New Movie Recording
* Using the red start/stop button record video
* Watch playback
* If youâ€™re not happy with the results, rerecord the video (Often it will take a few run throughs to get comfortable with script)
* When you're satisfied, go to the top left corner and click File > Save...
* Enter a name that you'd like to use for the saved file, and save it to your assets folder
* Shoot one video clip per script question (instead of one long video clip for all of the questions)
