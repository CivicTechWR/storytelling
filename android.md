## Recording on an Android device

* Find the camera app on your device’s home screen
* Make sure the device you are using has a rear-facing camera
* Open the camera app, and switch the mode from photo to recording (The photo mode will have a camera icon, while the recording mode has a red circle)
* Press the red circle and the recording will start
* Once you are finished, press the circle again and your recording is now saved.


## Exporting from an Android device

* Connect your device to the computer/laptop using a USB cable, usually your device’s charging cable will work
* Your device should ask whether you want to allow the PC to access the files, select the option to “allow”
* On Windows 10, go to the file explorer, and click on “This PC”
* Under “Devices and Drives” you should see your device’s name
* Click it, and keep clicking until you see a folder called “DCIM”
* Click the folder, and then find the folder named “Camera”, then click on it
* Wait a minute or two for everything in the folder to load, if you don’t have very many pictures or videos on your phone, it shouldn't take long
* Scroll down in the folder until you find the video, which should be the most recent thing you recorded, so it will be at the bottom
* Right-click on the video file and select copy
* Open your asset folder and paste the video file by going right-click-> “Paste”
