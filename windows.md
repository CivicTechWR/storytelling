## Recording on a Windows-powered computer

* Open Camera App
* Select Video
* Using the start/stop button record video
* Watch playback
* If youâ€™re not happy with the results, rerecord the video
  Often it will take a few run throughs to get comfortable with script
* Shoot one video clip per script question (instead of one long video clip for all of the questions)
* Save completed files in your asset folder
