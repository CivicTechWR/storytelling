# Video Capture

## Windows 10

* Open Camera App
* Select Video
* Using the start/stop button record video
* Watch playback
* If you’re not happy with the results, rerecord the video
  Often it will take a few run throughs to get comfortable with script
* Shoot one video clip per script question (instead of one long video clip for all of the questions)
* Save completed files in your asset folder

## Mac

## Android

### Exporting from an Android Device

* Connect your device to the computer/laptop using a USB cable, usually your device’s charging cable will work
* Your device should ask whether you want to allow the PC to access the files, select the option to “allow”
* On Windows 10, go to the file explorer, and click on “This PC”
* Under “Devices and Drives” you should see your device’s name
* Click it, and keep clicking until you see a folder called “DCIM”
* Click the folder, and then find the folder named “Camera”, then click on it
* Wait a minute or two for everything in the folder to load, if you don’t have very many pictures or videos on your phone, it shouldn't take long
* Scroll down in the folder until you find the video, which should be the most recent thing you recorded, so it will be at the bottom
* Right-click on the video file and select copy
* Open your asset folder and paste the video file by going right-click-> “Paste”
