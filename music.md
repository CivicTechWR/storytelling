# Finding Music

Look for music clips that are similar in length to the video you’re filming.
An easy way to find music is through Creative Commons and Free Music libraries

Once you’ve found music for your video, download it into your asset folder.

## [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)

You can use any track for free in your video content.
The music is a mix of public domain works and Creative Commons.
You do need to attribute the owner of the track.
To get the most out of the YouTube library, make use of its search functions.
For instance, you can search according to mood such as "calm," "dramatic," or "funky."
Or you can search according to the duration of the track, which is a good idea to make sure it fits the length of your content.

## [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/)  

The songs at the Free Music Archive are mostly different types of Creative Commons licenses.
Some are for non-commercial use only, others require attribution, and so on.
Please make sure to attribute and conform to all required guidelines.

## [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds/?filter.license=to_share)  

SoundCloud can be an excellent source of music to use for videos.
You can filter your search to show tracks that are licensed for reuse.
Type in “background music,” or try something like “uplifting background music,” “ambient beat,” etc.
