## Asset Folder

Create a folder on your hard drive where you will collect assets for your video.
Assets should include video, music, logos, photos, scripts, etc.

## Camera

Use the camera on your phone or laptop

## Mic

Consider using the mic from a set of earbuds.
Often it is best to try out options and see what has the best results.

## Clock/Timer

Having a clock or timer visible while youâ€™re shooting will make sure that your script is on time.

## Video Editing Software -- OpenShot

If this is your first video, download and install OpenShot from: https://www.openshot.org/download/
