# Digital Storytelling Process

## Toolkit

1. Asset Folder  
   Create a folder on your hard drive where you will collect assets for your video.
   Assets should include video, music, logos, photos, scripts, etc.
2. Camera  
   Use the camera on your phone or laptop
3. Mic  
   Consider using the mic from a set of earbuds. Often it is best to try out options and see what has the best results.
4. Clock/Timer  
   Having a clock or timer visible while you’re shooting will make sure that your script is on time.
5. Video Editing software -- OpenShot  
   If this is your first video, download and install OpenShot from: https://www.openshot.org/download/

## Story Telling

### Writing a Script

* Ask yourself, “What story do I want to tell?”
* Choose a Story Archetype that suits the story you want to tell
* Using the story outline, craft a series of questions you want the video to answer
* Write the script by answering those questions

### Story Archetypes

* Getting to know you  
   A simple way of finding out more about an individual, organization or campaign.
   Scripts consist of simple questions (see list of sample questions in Appendix A: Story Outlines)
   that are answered by the person(s) on camera. Questions are often displayed as titles in the video
   (see Titling under Video Editing section)
* Common denominator, plots in common, binding issues, building a case
* Overcoming obstacles
* Traditional Narrative Arch
* Time lapse or Whatever happened to?  
   A quick way of talking about the history of a place, person or idea.
   Script can consist of simple questions (see list of sample questions in Appendix A: Story Outlines)
   that can be answered by individuals on camera or a narrator.
   Questions are either displayed as titles or asked by a narrator.
* Unpacking an issue
* Making an Ask

## Setting up for Shooting

### Backdrop

* Be aware of your background
* What are you wearing (logos)

### Lighting

* Light sources should be out of the shot
* Try to avoid windows behind the subject
* Use diffuse light -- large light sources -- when possible to avoid hard shadows

### Sound

* Test the mic on your phone/computer vs. earbuds and use what sounds best
* USB mics are an inexpensive upgrade ($20-$40) if you want better sound

## Video Capture

### Windows 10

* Open Camera App
* Select Video
* Using the start/stop button record video
* Watch playback
* If you’re not happy with the results, rerecord the video  
  Often it will take a few run throughs to get comfortable with script
* Shoot one video clip per script question (instead of one long video clip for all of the questions)
* Save completed files in your asset folder

### Mac

### Android

#### Exporting from an Android Device

* Connect your device to the computer/laptop using a USB cable, usually your device’s charging cable will work
* Your device should ask whether you want to allow the PC to access the files, select the option to “allow”
* On Windows 10, go to the file explorer, and click on “This PC”
* Under “Devices and Drives” you should see your device’s name
* Click it, and keep clicking until you see a folder called “DCIM”
* Click the folder, and then find the folder named “Camera”, then click on it
* Wait a minute or two for everything in the folder to load, if you don’t have very many pictures or videos on your phone, it shouldn't take long
* Scroll down in the folder until you find the video, which should be the most recent thing you recorded, so it will be at the bottom
* Right-click on the video file and select copy
* Open your asset folder and paste the video file by going right-click-> “Paste”

### iOS

## Finding Music

Look for music clips that are similar in length to the video you’re filming. An easy way to find music is through Creative Commons and Free Music libraries

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)  
  You can use any track for free in your video content. The music is a mix of public domain works and Creative Commons. You do need to attribute the owner of the track. To get the most out of the YouTube library, make use of its search functions. For instance, you can search according to mood such as "calm," "dramatic," or "funky." Or you can search according to the duration of the track, which is a good idea to make sure it fits the length of your content.
* [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/)
* [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/)  
  The songs at the Free Music Archive are mostly different types of Creative Commons licenses. Some are for non-commercial use only, others require attribution, and so on. Please make sure to attribute and conform to all required guidelines.
* [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/collections.php)
* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds/?filter.license=to_share)  
  SoundCloud can be an excellent source of music to use for videos. You can filter your search to show tracks that are licensed for reuse. Type in “background music,” or try something like “uplifting background music,” “ambient beat,” etc.

Once you’ve found music for your video, download it into your asset folder.

## Finding Images

There are libraries of free images available online

### [WikiMedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

Content under open content licenses may be reused without any need to contact the licensor(s), but just keep in mind that:

* some licenses require that the original creator be attributed;
* some licenses require that the specific license be identified when reusing (including, in some cases, stating or linking to the terms of the license);
* some licenses require that if you modify the work, your modifications must also be similarly freely licensed

### [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/)

You can use CC-licensed materials as long as you follow the license conditions. One condition of all CC licenses is attribution.  How to give attribution: https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/get-permission/

## Video Editing with OpenShot

### Getting Started

* Create a new folder on your desktop called “assets”
* Place all your clips and music inside the asset folder
* Open OpenShot and your asset folder
* Drag and drop your asset collection (excluding the script) into OpenShot in the Project Files window
* Save the project inside the asset folder, by going to top menu, under file, and selecting  “Save Project As”, a window will appear, find the asset folder and select it, name the project file, then click save NOTE: OpenShot will create its own “assets” folder inside the one you’ve saved to, simply just ignore that one

### Editing Individual Clips

* Not all of your clips are going to be perfect. If you want to remove a portion of the clip, drag it onto your top track (default is Track 5)
* Right click on the clip and copy it
* By dragging the back of the original clip remove the unwanted portion
* By dragging the front of the copied clip have it start at the part you want to keep
* Overlap the two clips slightly to create a crossfade
* When you have the clip how you want it, use the red record button in the top menu to save the clip
* Make sure to save it in your asset folder
* Drag it back into the Project Files window
* Delete the unwanted original clip from your Project Files

### Creating Titles

* The top menu contains a tab called Titles
* Select it and then select Title underneath it
* A Title window will pop up
* Use the window to select what kind of title you want, what text you want it to display, background colour, font, etc.
* When you’re happy with it, save it
* It will appear in your Project Files as an Image

### Creating Subtitles

* Create a new text file inside your asset folder
* In this text file write all of the text for the subtitles you want in the video
* Select the title tab in the top menu, and select title, a window will appear
* Scroll down on the left and use one of the footer templates
* Name the file on the right
* In the text section, enter part of the text from the file you created before, ideally you will want to create the subtitles one sentence at a time
* Change the font and text colour to whatever you like, but try to keep the font size reasonable, and do not change the background colour once you’re happy with it, hit save
* Repeat the last two steps for all of the remaining subtitles

### Smashing it all Together

* Highlight all your assets under Project Files (outside of your Music and Subtitles)
* Right click and select Add to Timeline
* An Add to Timeline window will pop up
* Make sure “Start Time” is set to 0:00
* Beside “Image Length”, enter 7 seconds
* Change Transition from “None” to “Fade”
* Reposition your assets (on the left hand side) chronologically (top being the first, bottom the last) by highlighting a single asset and moving it up and down using the arrows at the bottom
* Press OK when you’re happy and the assets will be added to Track 5
* Drag the subtitle files one at a time from the assets window on the left onto the main timeline (track 5)
* Move the subtitles around to the correct position within the video by dragging them on the timeline
* Remove the fade transition that was added by right-clicking it, and selecting “remove transition”
* Adjust the length by dragging the end of the tile to the left or right
* Repeat the last two steps for the rest of the subtitles, make sure there is a slight gap between the subtitles on the timeline, to do this, disable the snapping tool (magnet icon under the word “timeline”)
* Drag and drop your music asset to track 4
* Adjust the volume by right clicking on the track and resetting the level
* Give it a listen by pressing play and tweak things as needed

### Exporting the Video

* In the pop up window choose a File Name
* Leave the folder path as is
* Under Profile select Web
* Under Target select YouTube HD
* Use the default video profile, then click export video

## Publishing the Video

* Go to https://www.youtube.com
* Create an account if you do not already have one
* On the main page in the top right corner, click on the camera icon with a plus sign on it, this is the button for creating/uploading videos
* From the drop-down menu, click “upload video”
* Either drag the exported video file from it’s location onto the “Select files to upload” portion of the screen, or click the arrow icon and select the video file from the location
* After this the upload page will appear, give the video a title, put in a description, but leave the tags and everything else as is
