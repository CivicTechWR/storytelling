title: Digital Storytelling Process
toc: false
---

The project began when a local service agency asked CivicTech WR to help them tell their story using digital media. After a conversation, a Digital Storytelling framework was agreed upon. The framework would need to meet the following criteria:

* Be open source
* Take less than 30 minutes to complete*
* Look and sound professional

For our current iteration, weâ€™ve targeted a 2 minute video because of the 30 minute time restriction.

*Please note: the process will take longer the first time because of the time needed to download the software.
